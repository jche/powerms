# powerms package



## Notes on installation

For the Mac, when I did a GitHub pull and then tried to install the package locally, I had to manually change the configure file to executable in the terminal.  I.e., in the terminal I wrote

```
> chmod +x configure
```

And then I was able to "Clean and Install" using RStudio.
